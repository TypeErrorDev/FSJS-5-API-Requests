# FSJS-5-API-Requests

## Description

For this project, I built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

## Overview

### The challenge

In this project, I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I requestd JSON objects from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

A search feature has been added so that students can be filtered by name.

Frameworks, libraries or plugins are not permitted as the focus of this project is to fine tune my ability to work with API's and objects.

### Future plans

I will be adding the following features in the next iteration of updates:

- List/Grid view
- Custom results displayed

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Employee API Database hosted by Netlify](https://typeerrordev-employee-api.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [Javascript](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/#sec-intro) - ES6

### Style Updates

- Modal was "inspired by the modal from randomuser's API site

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give thanks to the Student Success Mentors with Team Treehouse, the other students in their Slack channel and my friends on Discord that helped me along the way. Without everyone's support, I'd still be figuring out how to center a <div>

Finally, I'd like to acknowledge Voice Chat 3 in #100Devs for assisting me with the project.
